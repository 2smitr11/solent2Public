### A simple UML model of the project 

![alt text](../UMLmodel/images/classDiagram.png "Figure classDiagram.png" )

DTO classes are at the bottom of the diagram. 
These are simple java beans which are used to pass information between layers.

Service in the middle of the diagram.
These are used to items to put in the shopping cart

### Full UML model showing implementation and factory classes
This diagram shows the implementation and factory classes and the supporting classes provided by the web container.
Usually a model doesn't need to go into this detail if we know the supporting classes exist.

## Use Cases and Robustness Diagrams


We can use draw.io https://www.draw.io/ to draw other UML diagrams such as Use Cases, Robustness diagrams and Sequence diagrams. 

The draw.io xml files and their related .png images are in the drawio folder. 

These are also referenced below;
