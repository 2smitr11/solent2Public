A simple UML model of the project 

![alt text](../webApplicationExercise2/images/classDiagram.png "Figure classDiagram.png" )

DTO classes are at the bottom of the diagram. 
These are simple java beans which are used to pass information between layers.

Service in the middle of the diagram.
These are used to items to put in the shopping cart


## Use Cases and Robustness Diagrams


We can use draw.io https://www.draw.io/ to draw other UML diagrams such as Use Cases, Robustness diagrams and Sequence diagrams. 

The draw.io ,drawio files and their related .png images are in the drawio folder. 

These are also referenced below;


### Use Case Diagram

For a tutorial on use case diagrams see
https://drawio-app.com/uml-use-case-diagrams-with-draw-io/

Although not using drawio - this is also a good tutorial
https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-use-case-diagram

For a fuller description of use cases see  [Schaum's outline of UML
Bennett, Simon.2nd ed.; c2005 in Solent library](https://catalogue.solent.ac.uk/permalink/44SSU_INST/bslj9g/alma990096667340204796)
