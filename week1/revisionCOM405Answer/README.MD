Week 10 - Polymorphism

This week the tasks are simple in structure

You will need to look back at the past programs you have written during this unit and practice testing them using JUnit.

Tasks that you may consider creating test classes for:

    Passengers on a bus (Aggregation and Arrays)
    The toll bridge (Polymorphism)
    Your first assignment - The Kennel Company (I would advise creating a duplicate version and practicing on that)
