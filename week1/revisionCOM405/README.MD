# This exercise is adapted from COM 405 Week 10 - Polymorphism

Rather than build a GUI, we will simply create a model and JUNIT tests which test the model

To see the use case look at  [Week_10_PolymorphismOOP.pdf](../revisionCOM405/Week_10_PolymorphismOOP.pdf)

The model has already been created for you and you can see a UML model of it below

To remind yourself about polymorphism see  [Week 10 PolymorphismGuidance.pdf](../revisionCOM405/Week_10_PolymorphismGuidance.pdf)

To remind yourself about Junit testing see  [Week_11_TestJunitGuidance.pdf](../revisionCOM405/Week_11_TestJunitGuidance.pdf)
